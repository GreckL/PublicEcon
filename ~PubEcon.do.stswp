***Q1 Provide descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, observations) for log per capita expenditures and revenues. Do you observe differences between municipalities run by male mayors and by female mayors? Explain why such differences cannot be interpreted as causal. [0.10 points]
des
sort female
by female: tabstat lptot_total lp_e_tax_fee lp_e_other, stats(mean, sd, n)

*Answer: We observe some differences as expected but we cannot interpret this as causal as there exist many confounders. That means covariates could drive or hide outcomes of a naive test. One example would be share of employed within a city. High employment could be related to the willigness to test a women as a major while also being positivly correlated with revenues / overall health of public finance. 


***Q2 Run an OLS regression of log per capita total expenditures on the female dummy. Then, estimate a regression controlling for covariates (choose which ones to include and justify why). Finally, estimate a regression with municipality fixed effects (keep control ling for the relevant time-varying covariates). Under what conditions can each of these estimates be interpreted as causal? [0.35 points]
 
reg lptot_total female 

global g_controls =  "sh_empl sh_hschool hs_mayor sh_young_old logpop year share_fcons"
 
reg lptot_total female $g_controls, vce(hc2)

*Used: 
*1. sh_emply: As said in a)
*2. sh_hschool: Education drives election outcomes and potentially state of public finance e.g. by not providing enough checks on political leaders
*3. hs_mayor: Women might be differently educated, education drives political decisions, we want to isolate the effect of gender
*4. sh_young_old: Dependent groups increase expenditure, might be correlated to voting for women
*5. logpop: Bigger cities might have a more heterogeneous political scene and thus are more likely to vote for female mayors, while at the same time clearly influencing expenditure
*6. year: We might expect an increase in expenditure over time, while also growing more liberal towards female representation
*7. share_fcons: Females at any level might have the effect and if councillors are already female we expect a more liberal city, so we have to control for this as we are only want the effect of female mayor

*Not used: 
*1. sh_illiteracy as correlated with sh_hschool with -0.7375
*2. population: Normally, if regression for log value we use log pop (?)
*3. lp_e_tax_fee, lp_e_other
*4.

**xtreg: should we use xtreg?


**The first one cannot really be considered causal, it is to simplistic. The second one can still face a number of issues even if selection bias is controlled for: There still might exist omitted variables or reverse causation.

***Q3 What is (are) the identifying assumption(s) for the female margin of victory to be used as a running variable in a regression discontinuity design? Provide evidence that the appropriate design is sharp RDD in this case. [0.10 points]
 
 *1. No manipulation around cutoff (No change in density (bunching or similar))
 *2. Running variable affects treatment (0.5 vote share does lead to female mayor)
 *3. Balanced covariates -> No other important variable is significantly altered while not able to be controlled for

**Graph check:
rdplot female mv 
*Seems good, treatment is sharp


***Q4 Check discontinuities in baseline covariates at the threshold of 0 for the female margin of victory. Are there any significant discontinuities? (Hint: estimate RDDs for each covariate to evaluate the statistical significance of the discontinuity). [0.20 points]

***This is obviously wrong

**Somehow, most of those seem to be showing manipulation



***Q5 Outline why it is important to verify the continuity of the running variable around the threshold, and explain what it means in this specific context. Show a graph with the density of the running variable. Is there any statistically significant discontinuity? [0.25 points]

*The continuity of the running variable is a core assumption. Else, we would have some evidence for manipulation around the cutoff. The sorting around the cutoff would then not be random. The population left and right of the cutoff could not be compared as there might be some hidden, but seemingly significant, difference between them. 

*Graph
rddensity mv, plot

**Manipulation test of running variable using default triangular kernel
rddensity mv, all
*Other kernels same result
rddensity mv, all kernel(uniform)
rddensity mv, all kernel(epanechnikov) 

**Under Conventional test statistic (not valid when using MSE-optimal bandwidth choice) we reject the null of no manipulation -> !!!! Is this valid here?
**We are fine until the window length / 2 of 0.01 or 0.013



***Q6 Show the RD plots and estimates of the effect of female mayors on log per capita total expenditures using the following approaches:

*Parametric local linear regression with optimal bandwidth (write down the estimated equation)

rdrobust lptot_total mv, p(1) c(0)
local bwl = e(h_l)
local bwr = e(h_r) 
rdplot lptot_total mv if (mv<=`bwr' & mv >= -`bwl'), c(0) p(1) kernel(tri) nbins(20 20) 


*Parametric regression on the full sample with 2nd order polynomial fit on both sides of the threshold (write down the estimated equation)




*Non-parametric local linear regression with optimal bandwidth. 

rdrobust lptot_total mv, p(1) c(0)
local bwl = e(h_l)
local bwr = e(h_r) 
rdplot lptot_total mv if (mv<=`bwr' & mv >= -`bwl'), c(0) p(1) kernel(tri) nbins(20 20) 


*Extra: Here also with p(2)
rdrobust lptot_total mv, p(2) c(0)
local bwl = e(h_l)
local bwr = e(h_r) 
rdplot lptot_total mv if (mv<=`bwr' & mv >= -`bwl'), c(0) p(2) kernel(tri) nbins(20 20) 


*What do you conclude? (Hint: use the features of the rdrobust command). [0.75 points]






***Q7 Show how the estimates vary at different bandwidths (e.g., from 2 to 30%). Report a graph or a table with each estimate together with 95% confidence intervals. [0.50 points]

***Q8 Gagliarducci and Paserman (2012) suggest that female mayors' policy-making is influenced by the share of women in the municipal council. Report heterogeneous effects using the variable share_fcons as a continuous variable and as a discrete variable (Hint: generate quartiles of the share and interact the female dummy with them as factor variables; see command xtile).
